                        General of the Army Raden Sudirman (Old Spelling: Soedirman) born 24 January 1916. was a
                        high-ranking Indonesian military officer during the Indonesian National Revolution. The first
                        commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces.

                        <br><br>

                        Sudirman is a figure respected by his troops in Indonesian history as a hero of the National
                        revolution. He had a very big role during the revolution to seize Indonesian independence from
                        the Dutch colonials. General Sudirman later became the first commander in chief as well as the
                        first General RI with the youngest age, namely 31 years.

                                    Kalibagor, Banyumas, and Mrs. Siyem who was descended from Wedana Rembang. He has

                                    After graduating from Wirotomo, Sudirman studied for one year at the Kweekschool
                                    (teacher school) run by Muhammadiyah in Surakarta but quit due to lack of funds. In
                                    1936, he returned to Cilacap to teach at a Muhammadiyah elementary school, having
                                    been trained by his teachers at Wirotomo.

                                    Sudirman continued to teach, before joining the Japanese-sponsored Defenders of the
                                    Homeland as a battalion commander in Banyumas. In this position he put down a
                                    rebellion by his fellow soldiers, but was later interned in Bogor.

                                    <br><br>

                                    As a teacher, Sudirman taught his students lessons on morality using examples from
                                    the lives of the prophets and traditional wayang stories. One of his students later
                                    recalled that Sudirman was an even-handed and patient teacher who would mix humour
                                    and nationalism in his lessons

                                    When World War II broke out in Europe, it was thought that Japan, already moving
                                    closer to mainland China, would attempt to invade the Indies. In response, the Dutch
                                    colonial government – which had previously restricted military training to natives –
                                    began teaching people how to deal with air raids. Following up on this, the Dutch
                                    then formed an Air Attack Preparation team.

                                    Sudirman, who was respected by the community, was asked to lead the team in Cilacap.
                                    Apart from teaching local residents about safety procedures to deal with air
                                    attacks, Sudirman also established monitoring posts throughout the area. He and
                                    Holland also handled aircraft dropping material to simulate bombing; it aims to
                                    increase the response rate.

                                    As a newly independent country and did not yet have a professional military, on
                                    October 5, 1945, Soekarno issued a decree establishing the People's Security Army
                                    (TKR, now known as the Indonesian National Army). Most of the personnel are former
                                    KNIL soldiers, while the senior officers are from PETA and Heihō.

                                    On November 12, 1945, in the first meeting of the TKR, Sudirman was elected as the
                                    leader of the TKR after going through a two-stage deadlocked vote. In the third
                                    stage, Oerip collected 21 votes, while Sudirman was ahead with 22 votes; the
                                    commanders of the Sumatran division all voted for Sudirman. Sudirman, then 29 years
                                    old, was surprised by the election results and offered to relinquish the position to
                                    Oerip, but the meeting participants would not allow it. Oerip, who had lost control
                                    of the meeting even before voting began, was pleased that he was no longer in charge
                                    of TKR. Sudirman continued to appoint Oerip as chief of staff. In accordance with
                                    his new position, Sudirman was promoted to General.

                            In early August Sudirman approached Sukarno and asked him to continue the guerrilla war;
                            Sudirman did not expect the Dutch to abide by the Roem-Royen Agreement, based on the
                            failings of the previous agreements. Sukarno disagreed, which was a blow to Sudirman. When
                            Sudirman threatened to resign his post, blaming the government's inconsistency for his
                            tuberculosis and Oerip's death in November 1948, Sukarno threatened to do so as well. As he
                            thought that such a resignation would have a destabilising effect, Sudirman stayed his hand
                            and a Java-wide cease fire came into effect on 11 August 1949.
